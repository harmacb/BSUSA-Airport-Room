# BuildingSMART USA Airport Room – Information Delivery Standards

## Overview
Welcome to the **BuildingSMART USA Airport Room** repository for **Information Delivery Manuals (IDMs)** and **Information Delivery Specifications (IDS)**. This repository serves as a collaborative space for industry experts, consultants, and software vendors to develop and refine data exchange standards tailored to the **airport industry** in the context of **BIM, digital twins, GIS, and simulation**.

Our goal is to establish structured, standardized workflows and machine-readable specifications that enable seamless data exchanges across various aviation stakeholders.
